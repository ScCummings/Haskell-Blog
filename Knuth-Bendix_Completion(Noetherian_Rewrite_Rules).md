# Knuth-Bendix Completion (Noetherian Rewrite Rules)

This blog post is a continuation of my post on complexity with regards to *Abstract Reduction Systems*. There I also defined and redefined some terms that will be 
very helpful to understand before reading further. My goal in this blog post is to continue my analysis of the paper "An Introduction to Knuth-Bendix Completion" by 
A.J.J. Dick. In doing so I hope to learn more terms and mathematical strategies for assessing algorithms and also to try connections between this work and what we 
have been learning in our course.
