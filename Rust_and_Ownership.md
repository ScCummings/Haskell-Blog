# Rust and Ownership (Blog Post 12)

This blog post will cover introductory topics for the programming language rust and Ownership, a unique aspect of the language. It will be similiar in structure to my posts on Unison in terms of sticking to abstract notions of the language as opposed to practical applications. I take this approach as I believe it has more educational value to me. Learning the aspects of these languages and how they differentiate themselves is probably more valuable than the experience of programming in them and learning their syntax.
