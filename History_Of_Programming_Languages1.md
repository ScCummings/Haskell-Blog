# History of Programming Languages 1 (Blog Post 16)

My idea with these last few blog posts is to delve into the history of programming languages and how they have interacted with the culture, scientific advancements, 
and events that shaped the times that they were created in. I am not sure how many I do of these but given I tend to be a huge history nerd, I may fill these last 
three entries with musings on the histories I can find and decifer. 

The first programming language created that actually had an associated compiler was created by Corrado BÃ¶hm in 1951 for his Dissertation. I actually wanted to 
perhaps write a blog post about it though quickly ran into the issue of not being able to speak French. 

Having scrapped that idea, I searched through the early histories of programming languages in order to find something worth exploring in detail.
