# Recursion & Functional Programming (Blog Post 1)
The following blog was created in accordance with the assignment specifications for the course *CPSC 354: Programming Languages* taught at Chapman University. Its
primary purpose is to act as a kind of guide and journal as I learn the programming language Haskell as well as the underlying logic and conceptual frameworks that

Consider for a moment a three dimensional vector $\vec{m}$

The following examples will use C++ code to explore how Haskell differs from other, what we will call imperative programming languages however you could just as 
easily use Python, Java, or any others.
